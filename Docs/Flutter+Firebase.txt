Firebase CLI: 

> npm install -g firebase-tools 

FlutterFire CLI:

> dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli 

Log in and test the Firebase CLI

> firebase login 
> firebase projects:list 

Configure:  

> flutterfire configure 

1 - Selecting a Firebase project (based on the .firebaserc file or from the Firebase Console).
2 - Prompt what platforms (e.g. Android, iOS, macOS & web) you would like configuration for.
3 - Identify which Firebase applications for the chosen platforms should be used to extract 
     configuration for. By default, the CLI will attempt to automatically match Firebase apps 
     based on your current project configuration.
4 - Generate a firebase_options.dart file in your project.

Once complete, you can now import the generated file and provide it to the initializeApp method:

   import 'firebase_options.dart';

After that, you may notice a error at the firebase_options.dart file, to fix it you will need to add the 
Firebase Core dependency to your project: 

> flutter pub add firebase_core 

InitializeApp:

  lib/main.dart 

  import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
  import 'firebase_options.dart';

  void main() async {
    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    await Firebase.initializeApp(
      options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
    );
    runApp(MyApp());
  }
